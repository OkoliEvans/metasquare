_Meta Square is an NFT-based smart ticketing platform designed for event hosts and attendees. The platform provides a secure and transparent way for event hosts to manage their events and ticket sales, while also giving attendees a unique and valuable experience._

## How It Works:

**Generate ID:** Event hosts contacts the MetaSquare Team and we generate a unique ID on the Meta Square platform which they use to create events.

**Attendee Registration:** Attendees can then register for these events using their wallets, and for each registration, an NFT representing the ticket will be minted to their wallet. This ensures that no user can register twice and prevents ticket fraud.

**POAP Distribution:** After the event, attendees will be able to mint a special POAP NFT provided by Meta Square. These POAPs can be sold in secondary markets, providing additional value to attendees.
